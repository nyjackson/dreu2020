## Step Four: Create Variable Panel, Center-Top 

By using the same steps and knowledge to create the code panel, I created a variable panel with the variables given in ```mainExample```.

## Step Five: Add Grid Panel On Right

How do I create a grid?

**Fix:** 
  - I created ten view boxes within a view box (and this was repeated 10 times). After 100 lines of code to create the grid, I realized that I had to optimize my code. Following the statement made in one of the Udemy course, "Do not repeat any code," I created an array `grid_cols` to create a map loop that would print the correct number of columns. 
  
```
<View style={styles.grid_panel}>
      {grid_rows.map(row => (
        <View style>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
          <View style = {styles.grid_fixed_ratio}/>
  </View>
))}
</View>
```

This helped a lot, but I could optimize it more. 

How do I optimize my code better? 

**Fix(es):** 
  - Created two constant integers to determine the grid's column and row amount.
   How do I use the const to loop correctly?
   - Turns out `render()` does not like loops inside of it, so I decided to create a separate class that handles the creation of the grid, and then called it during `render()` of `GridPanel` class. 
   ```
   
   ```
    
**Acquired Knowledge:** 
  - `render()` + for loops
