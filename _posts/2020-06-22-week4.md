This week mostly consisted of finding and annotating some of the articles to use for my final report, completing sections 5 & 6 of the AJC course, and focusing on populating the memory of the program into the stack grid efficiently. 

## Step Six: Populate Memory From Stack ##

How do I display the correct info in the grid?

**Fix(es):**
  - I created an additional panel component that would serve as an overlay that would change its information based on the code selected in `codePanel`. This panel also contains the row numbers. 
  - I created `States` within the `mainExample` object that will contain the string output of the chosen line in the class example. This way  
 
 **Attempts:**
  - After successfully adding the row numbers atop the grid, I considered how to change the `stateOverlay` successfully. 
  - I considered trying to re-implement the grid, so that an additional overlay was not needed. I tried by creaint a 2d array rather than 
  
How do I attain the memory from the stack?
