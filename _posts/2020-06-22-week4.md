## Step Six: Populate Memory From Stack ##

How do I display the correct info in the grid?
**Fix(es)**
  - I created an additional panel component that would serve as ian overlay that would change its information based on the code selected in `codePanel`. This panel also contains the row numbers for identification. 
 
 **Atempts**
  - After successfully adding the row numbers atop the grid, I considered how to change the `stateOverlay` successfully. 
How do I attain the memory from the stack?
