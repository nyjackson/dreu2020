title: Week 5
---

This week consisted of combining research on step 6 and step 7. In order to correctly show the right output of the program at the selected line in `codePanel`, the `gridPanel` must be able to interact with the codePanel accordingly. 

## Steps 6 + 7: Memory Display, Animations, and Interactions ##

I researched multiple sites and React packages that create interactive grids; with them, I attempted and failed to create multiple grids.

**How do I do this?** 
  - I started learning more about data tranference between Parent and Child componenets.
  
### Thoughts ###
- If I can pass the updated 2d array that contains the stack memory's final output at the end of `mainExample`, then I should be able to display its information in the cells. Right?

## Concerns ## 
- I am still confused by React. In examples I found online, the HTML tags work in a React extended class, but when I try to use it in Simr, I get errors.
