This week consisted of combining research on step 6 and step 7. In order to correctly show the right output of the program at the selected line in `codePanel`, the `gridPanel` must be able to interact with the codePanel accordingly. 

## Steps 6 + 7: Memory Display, Animations, and Interactions ##

I researched multiple types and React packages that create interactive grids; with them, I attempted and failed to create multiple grids.

How do I do this?
