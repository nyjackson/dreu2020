## Step 9 Continued ##

## Step 10: Update memory panel to be in sync with snippets ##
How do I connect the buttons from `CodePanel` to `GridPanel`?

**Attempts:**
- Created a `changeGrid` function that would update the state of the codePanel and update the gridPanel accordingly by changing the `output` property. 
- Using the `connect` function used in `store.js` of one of the projects in the Udemy Creating VR Experiences course, I connected the `CodePanel` and the `GridPanel` so any update to the `CodePanel` will change the state of `GridPanel`. 

**Errors:**
- "Invariant Violation: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops."
