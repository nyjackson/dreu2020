title: Week 10
---
This week mainly consisted of finalizing step 10 and 11, and working on my final report. 

## Step 10 Continued ##
Why is the `gridOutput` not printing in the grid?

**Notes:**
- All previous errors have been fixed.
- No errors are shown, `console.log(gridOutput)` gives the correct output, but no update occurs. 

**Fix:** 
- ``<Text style = {styles.state_text}> {gridArray[j][i] || ' '}</Text>``
    - Added null check. 


## Step 11: Loading Screen ##
Using Lesson Seven of Project #1 of the *Creating VR Experiences with React*, I can create a home page that will load into the react 360 scene.
