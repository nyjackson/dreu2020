## Step 7 Update ##
- I couldn't fix my errors, but I decided to create a button on `StateOverlay` to turn the ASCII attribute on/off.

## Step 10 Continued ##
Why is the `gridOutput` not printing in the grid?

**Notes:**
- All previous errors have been fixed.
- No errors are shown, `console.log(gridOutput)` gives the correct output, but no update occurs. 
- Not entering for loop for some reason...


## Step 11: Loading Screen ##
Using Lesson Seven of Project #1 of the `Creating VR Experiences with React`, I can create a home page that will load into the react 360 scene. 

Why is the screen turning white after button press?

**Thoughts:**
- Might be a lag issue.
