title: Week 10
---
This week mainly consisted of finalizing step 10 and 11, and working on my final report. 

## Step 10 Continued ##
Why is the `gridOutput` not printing in the grid?

**Notes:**
- All previous errors have been fixed.
- No errors are shown, `console.log(gridOutput)` gives the correct output, but no update occurs. 

**Fix:** 
- ``<Text style = {styles.state_text}> {gridArray[j][i] || ' '}</Text>``
    - Added null check. 


## Step 11: Loading Screen ##
Using Lesson Seven of Project #1 of the *Creating VR Experiences with React*, I can create a home page that will load into the react 360 scene. 
I decided to use Bootstrap to help make the loading screen to look a bit more completed. I installed Bootstrap and tried to start up the application and got the following errors. 

**Errors:** 

● Validation Warning:

  Unknown option "getProjectRoots" with value getProjectRoots() {
    return getRoots();
  } was found.
  This is probably a typing mistake. Fixing it will remove this message.

● Validation Warning:

  Unknown option "getBlacklistRE" with value getBlacklistRE() {
    return blacklist([
    ]);
  } was found.
  This is probably a typing mistake. Fixing it will remove this message.

● Validation Warning:

  Unknown option "getAssetExts" with value getAssetExts() {
    return ['obj', 'mtl'];
  } was found.
  This is probably a typing mistake. Fixing it will remove this message.

● Validation Warning:

  Unknown option "getPlatforms" with value getPlatforms() {
    return ['vr'];
  } was found.
  This is probably a typing mistake. Fixing it will remove this message.

● Validation Warning:

  Unknown option "getProvidesModuleNodeModules" with value getProvidesModuleNodeModules() {
    return ['react-native', 'react-360'];
  } was found.
  This is probably a typing mistake. Fixing it will remove this message.
  
- client.js: Plugin/Preset files are not allowed to export objects, only functions. In C:\Users\Ny\Summer2020\node_modules\babel-preset-react-native\index.js

**Attempts**
 - Changed the var blacklist (as done before to fix an issue in downloading react 360) and added modules
    - Solution from https://github.com/facebook/react-360/issues/778 and https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21093
 - Changed rn-cli.config file to metro.config
 - Re/installed some packages ranging from react@^16 
 - Uninstalled Bootstrap
 
Unfortunately, I was unable to figure out why the errors were happening and I couldn't get client.js to load afterward because of the following error.
