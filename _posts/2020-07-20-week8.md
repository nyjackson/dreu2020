title: Week 8
---

This week consisted of finishing step 8, starting on step 9, and preparing my final report for a brief evaluation by Professor Anderson. 

## Step 7 Continued ##
No update as of yet. Will place this step on the back burner. 

## Step 9: Create Animations/Interactions to Step Through Code (Highlighting + Checking) ##

How do I change my buttons to highlights? 

**Ideas:**
 - I can use onMouseEnter property to change the color once something hovers over the code snippet?
