title: Week 8
---

This week consisted of finishing step 8, starting on step 9, and preparing my final report for a brief evaluation by Professor Anderson. 

## Step 7 Continued ##
No update as of yet. Will place this step on the back burner. 

## Step 9: Create Animations/Interactions to Step Through Code (Highlighting + Checking) ##
How do I get highlight the code `onMouseEnter`of the buttons?

**Attempts:**
- Created a `changeGrid` function that would update the state of the codePanel and update the gridPanel accordingly by changing the `output` property. 

**Errors:**
- "Invariant Violation: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops."
