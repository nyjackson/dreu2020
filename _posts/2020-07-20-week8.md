title: Week 8
---

This week consisted of finishing step 8, starting on step 9, and preparing my final report for a brief evaluation by Professor Anderson. 

## Step 7 Continued ##
No update as of yet. 

**Attempts:**
- I created a new React 360 enviornment to test the `Entity` component. I tried using a new 3D obj, removing the center panel, and changing the location of the .obj and .mtl files. No change. 

Will place this step on the back burner. 

## Step 9: Create Animations/Interactions to Step Through Code (Highlighting + Checking) ##

How do I get the buttons functional?

How do I change the color of the button on hover over?

**Attempts:**

**Errors:**

**Fixes:**
