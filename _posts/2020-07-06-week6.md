title: Week 6
---

This week consisted of adding the magnifying glass 3d object into Simr (so that it reveals the ASCII code of the output of `mainExample` when held over the `gridPanel`), and writing code that will implement step 8.

## Step 7 ##
Using a magnifying glass poly from Google Poly and the `Entity` component, I added it to Simr. At first, it didn't appear. I asked Dr.Anderson for aid and began writing code for step 8. 

## Step 8: Break code into snippets that can be sequenced ##
 Using knowledge learned from the Udemy *Creating VR Experiences*, I made each line of `mainExample` a button, so that onClick these buttons would change the `VariablePanel` and `CodePanel` accordingly.
