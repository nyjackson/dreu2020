title: Week 6
---

This week consisted of mainly writing/testing code that will implement step 8, and attempting to add a magnifying glass 3d object into Simr, so that it reveals the ASCII code of the output of `mainExample` when held over the `gridPanel`.

## Step 7: Interactions and Animations ##
Using a magnifying glass poly from Google Poly and the `Entity` component, I added it to Simr. At first, it didn't appear. I asked Dr.Anderson for aid, and began writing code for step 8.

## Step 8: Break code into snippets that can be sequenced ##
 Using knowledge learned from the Udemy *Creating VR Experiences*, I made each line of `mainExample` a button, so that onClick these buttons would change the `VariablePanel` and `CodePanel` accordingly. I created a separate repl.it enviornment to create and test my `getVariables` and `updateGridPanelOutput` functions that will lay within `CodePanel render()`. I was unable to finish both methods, so this will continue to be implemented next week.
