title: Week 6
---

This week consisted of mainly writing/testing code that will implement step 8, and attempting to add a magnifying glass 3d object into Simr, so that it reveals the ASCII code of the output of `mainExample` when held over the `gridPanel`.

## Step 7: Interactions and Animations ##
Using a magnifying glass poly from Google Poly and the `Entity` component, I added it to Simr.

**Errors:**
 - `Entity` component not registered 
    
    **Fix:**
     - `import Entity from 'Entity'` rather than `import Entity from 'react-360'`
     
 - Even though the `Entity` component was rendered successfully, the magnifying glass did not appear in the environment.  
   
   **Attempt:**
     - Changed scale and  values 

## Step 8: Break code into snippets that can be sequenced ##
 Using knowledge learned from the Udemy *Creating VR Experiences*, I made each line of `mainExample` a button, so that onClick these buttons would change the `VariablePanel` and `CodePanel` accordingly. I created a separate repl.it enviornment to create and test my `getVariables` and `getCodeSnippets` functions that will lay within `CodePanel render()`. I was unable to finish both functions, so this will continue to be implemented next week. 
 
**Thoughts**
- I am creating the `getVariables` function, so that when code is inputted into the `mainExample`, the variables will be automatically collected and displayed in `VariablePanel`. Though this is not a step, I think it is a helpful feature to add.
