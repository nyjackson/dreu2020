This week consisted of working on step 8 and answering questions to consider for possible article citations. 

## Step 7 Update ##
  Professor Anderson will go over the error and get back to me. 
  
## Step 8 Continued ##

How do I correctly separate the code into snippets?

**Fix:**
- Using the map function, I added a `states` object that contains all the different states the code would run through, then I made all the code snippets that evoke change, become buttons that changed color based on the `<VRButton>`'s `onEnter` property. I changed the color, so that the user is aware of the clickable event which will modify the gridPanel accordingly.
