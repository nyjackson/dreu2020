This week consisted of working on step 8 and answering questions to consider for possible article citations. 

## Step 7 Update ##
  Professor Anderson will go over the error and get back to me. 
  
## Step 8 Continued ##

How do I correctly separate the code into snippets?

**Fix:**
- Using the map function, I added a `states` object that contains all the different states the code would run through, then I made all the code snippets that evoke change, become `<VRButton>`s. I changed the bakground color to green , so that the user is aware of the clickable event which will modify the gridPanel accordingly. 

```
export const states = {
  state0: {
    code: ` #include <stdio.h>
             int i;
             int main (int argc, char *argv[])
             {`,
    gridOutput: '  ',
    forLoop:false,
  },
  state1:{
    code: `char text[] = "Hello World";
           char greeting[11];`,
    gridOutput: '  Hello World',
    forLoop:false,

  },
  state2:{
    code:`for(i=0;i<11;i++)
        greeting[i] = text[i];`,
    gridOutput:
      '  Hello WorldHello World',
    forLoop:true,
  },
  state3:{
    code:`printf(" %s ",greeting);
  }`,
    gridOutput: '  Hello WorldHello World 0'
  }
}

```

**Note:**
- This may not be ideal for the next step, but it separates the code distinctly.
