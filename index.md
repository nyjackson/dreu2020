## About Me

Hello! I am a rising senior majoring in Computer Science at Vassar College. 

## About My Mentor

Dr.Monica Anderson of the University of Alabama is a specialist in Artifical Intelligence, Robotics, and Computer Science Education.

## About My Project

Combining virtual reality and computer science education, Dr. Anderson, Keanna Wright and me will be working on a program that highlights coding errors by visualizing its effects on memory in VR: enabling students to attain a better mental model of the abstractness of memory. I will be using Javascript, specifically React 360, to create a browser compatible version, while Keanna will be working on an Unity based version.
