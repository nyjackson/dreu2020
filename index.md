## About Me

Hello my name is Nyala Jackson; I am a rising senior, and a Computer Science Major at Vassar College's Computer Science department. I will graduate in 2021 with a Bachelor of Arts. 

## About My Mentor

## About My Project

Combining virtual reality and computer science education, Dr. Anderson, Keanna Wright, and I will be working on a program that highlights coding errors by visualizing the code's effect on memory in VR: enabling students to attain a better mental model of the abstractness of memory. I will be using Javascript, specifically node.js and React 360, to create a browser-compatible version, while Keanna will be working on a Unity-based version.
